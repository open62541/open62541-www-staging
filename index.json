Any unauthorized use of the Certified for Compliance logo is prohibited. OPC Foundation Certified for Compliance logo indicates that this product has been tested by an independent certification lab and certified to be compliant with the following OPC UA Profiles which are part of the OPC UA Specifications:\n**Profile:**\nMicro Embedded Device Server\n**Security Policies:**\nBasic128Rsa15\nBasic256\nBasic256Sha256\n**User Tokens:**\nAnonymous Facet\nUser Name Password Server Facet\nMethod Server Facet\nNode Management Facet\nAdditional information about compliance testing, logo program and a summary of test results can be found at www.opcfoundation.org for: Open62541 OPC UA Server (server_ctt) 1.0.0-rc5.\nThe precise version used for the certification has the commit hash 1135945fe8eb8e4e9df7694e5d564443a6d4df80 . Later releases in the 1.0 release family contain only bugfixes in comparison to the certified version.\n**Certification Limitations \u0026amp; Common Misconceptions:**\nCertification was done for a reference server (\u0026ldquo;CTT server\u0026rdquo;) based on the open62541 SDK and not for the SDK itself. The server implementation used for the certification can be found at https://github.com/open62541/open62541/blob/1.0/examples/server_ctt.c. No Certification Grandfathering: There is no grandfathering of certification, users who want their application based on open62541 to be certified need to undergo separate testing at the OPC Foundation Test Lab Certification is attempted for selected feature-sets (facets). Some features are implemented but not under test at this time. These features are disabled by default in the SDK:\nFeatures submitted for testing are based on granularity of \u0026ldquo;facets\u0026rdquo; (Micro Embedded Device Server, Method Facet, Node Management Facet and the SecurityPolicies). Some additional conformance units (e.g. for events) are already implemented. But the corresponding \u0026ldquo;facet\u0026rdquo; is not yet complete JSON encoding is implemented in open62541. But the feature cannot be certified due to the lack of official test cases and tools Historical data access is implemented in open62541. But the feature is not testable with the current CTT. We did however implement the standard test cases for historical data (that are part of the spec) in our unit tests At the time of writing this section (Sep 2019), PubSub (UADP) is implemented in open62541. But the feature cannot be certified due to the lack of official test cases and testing tools. We did however implement the standard cases used for the PubSub interoperability workshop, where we participated earlier this year. It should be noted that Kalycito is member of IIC TSN Testbed and OPC Foundation and Fraunhofer IOSB is a member of OPC Foundation. This enables us to closely follow the technology evolution path and be an early adopter. Interested in our work? Next steps to take OSADL continues to actively support the project and fosters addition of new features and functions. To do so it welcomes new participants who may select from various contribution levels as outlined at https://www.osadl.org/LoI2 As this is a rapidly evolving technology space, the official standards and compliance tools are evolving fast and the open source code is evolving fast as well. You might want to get external support to get your products certified and also integrate the latest feature additions to open source into your products as soon as possible. Kalycito provides such support for integration and certification and you can find more details abut their services at https://www.kalycito.com/opc-ua-sdk/.\n","permalink":"open62541-www-staging/certified/","tags":null,"title":"Certified SDK"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Building from source\nA detailed description on how to build from source can be found here: Installing\nPrebuilt packages\nPrebuild binaries You can always find prebuild binaries for every release on our Github Release Page.\nNightly single file releases for Linux and Windows of the last 50 commits can be found here: https://open62541.org/releases/\nOS Specific packages\nDebian packages can be found in our official PPA:\n Daily Builds (based on master branch): https://launchpad.net/~open62541-team/+archive/ubuntu/daily Release Builds (starting with Version 1.0): https://launchpad.net/~open62541-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa  To install the open62541-dev stable package in Ubuntu, use these lines:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:open62541-team/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libopen62541-1-dev ","permalink":"open62541-www-staging/download/","tags":null,"title":"Download"}]
